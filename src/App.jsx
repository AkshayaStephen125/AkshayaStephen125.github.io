        <div className="about-wrapper reveal">
       <p>My journey as a developer began with a simple curiosity—how powerful ideas can be transformed into reliable software systems. Over the past six years, that curiosity has grown into a deep passion for building robust, scalable, and meaningful digital solutions.</p>
        <br/>
      <p>I am Akshaya Stephen, a Python developer who has spent years crafting backend systems using Python and Django, turning complex business requirements into clean, efficient, and secure applications and building REST APIs with JWT-based authentication, delivering secure and scalable backend services that power real-world applications. Along the way, I expanded my skills beyond backend development, stepping into full-stack engineering by working with ReactJS and exploring GraphQL, using Docker for containerization and CI/CD pipelines, while also building data workflows where I design and manage ETL pipelines and orchestration systems using Apache Airflow to support data-driven decision-making.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Having worked in a healthcare product-based company, I gained strong hands-on experience across B2B and B2C domains, building end-to-end systems from patient- and customer-facing applications to administration and management dashboards, covering complete workflows from purchase and sales processing to secure role-based permissions, automated reporting, and real-time notifications. </p>
      <br/>
      <p>My experience in service-based companies further shaped my adaptability. I worked across multiple projects, contributed to different application modules, and supported long-term maintenance and enhancements—learning how to build systems that evolve gracefully over time.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>I am passionate about continuous learning and growing my skills, exploring new technologies and best practices to strengthen my capabilities. My goal is to build robust, scalable, and meaningful software that not only solves real problems but also delivers tangible business value.</p>

The application enables users to create, update, and manage reminders through a clean and intuitive interface, while delivering alerts at precise times using real-time communication. The front end is built with React.js for a responsive and interactive user experience and styled using Tailwind CSS to maintain a modern, consistent design. On the back end, Django powers the core business logic and exposes a GraphQL API, allowing flexible and efficient data querying while minimizing over-fetching and improving overall performance.",
  "I built this project to strengthen my full-stack development expertise and gain hands-on experience with modern backend architectures and asynchronous systems. The project was designed to deeply explore GraphQL as an API layer, RabbitMQ as a messaging queue, and Celery for background task processing, particularly for time-based reminder scheduling and notification delivery. To ensure real-time updates, WebSockets were integrated for instant push notifications, creating a smooth and event-driven user experience. Through this project, I focused on building a scalable, decoupled architecture that demonstrates practical knowledge of full-stack development, messaging queues, and real-time systems working together in a production-like environment."
